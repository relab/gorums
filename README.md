Gorums [1] is a novel framework for building fault tolerant distributed systems.
Gorums offers a flexible and simple quorum call abstraction, used to communicate
with a set of processes, and to collect and process their responses. Gorums
provides separate abstractions for (a) selecting processes for a quorum call
and (b) processing replies. These abstractions simplify the main control flow
of protocol implementations, especially for quorum-based systems, where only a
subset of the replies to a quorum call need to be processed.

Gorums uses code generation to produce an RPC library that clients can use to
invoke quorum calls. Gorums is a wrapper around the [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
library. Services are defined using the protocol buffers interface definition
language.

## System Requirements

To build and deploy Gorums, you need the following software installed:

* Protobuf compiler (protoc)
* Make
* Ansible (used by benchmark script)

## Examples

The original EPaxos implementation modified to use Gorums can be found
[here](https://github.com/relab/epaxos).

A collection of different algorithms for reconfigurable atomic storage
implemented using Gorums can be found
[here](https://github.com/relab/smartmerge).
