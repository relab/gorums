# Developer Guide

The repository contains two main components:

- **dev:** the development code with a concrete (register) implementation
  for testing. The file also contains all the static code that will be bundled
  together with the generated code.
- **-plugins/gorums:** second order plugin to ```protoc-gen-gorums```
  binary.

#### File Endings

The following file ending conventions are used in the ```dev``` package:

* ```_gen.go```: File should be generated by the gorums plugin.
* ```_udef.go``` File is user defined.
* ```_test.go``` File is a Go test file.

These endings are important because all other files will be bundled together as
static resources during gorums code generation (see the
[bundle](https://github.com/relab/gorums/tree/master/cmd/bundle)) utility
program.

#### Workflow

1. Changes should be made to the development code in ```dev```.

2. Changes in any of the files ending with ```_gen.go``` **must** be reflected
   in the generator.

3. If the change is in a "static" file it's enough to update the bundle of
   static code. This can be done by calling ```make genstatic```. 

4. If any change is done to the static or generated code, the file representing
   the "golden" output of the generator must be regenerated. This can be done
   by running ```make gengolden```. 

See the Makefile for more details.

#### Testing

All tests can be invoked by running ```make test``` and/or ```make testrace```.
There are three main tests for this project:

1. **dev/config_rpc_test.go**: The integration test in this package
   verifies that the concrete client/server register implementation works.

2. **End-to-end**: This test invokes the generator with the ```register.proto```
   example from ```dev``` and runs the integration test against the
   *generated* code.

3. **Golden**: This test invokes the generator with the ```register.proto```
   example from ```dev``` and compares the output against a golden output
   file in the ```testdata``` folder. This test verifies that the generator
   output does not change unexpectedly.  The golden output file should be
   updated as described in the previous Workflow section if the output *is*
   expected to change.
